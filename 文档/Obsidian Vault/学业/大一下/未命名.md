Input features. To infer the speed of every I/O, our modeltakes three inputs: (a) the number of pending I/Os when anincoming I/O arrives (in the number of 4KB pages, includingthe incoming I/O), (b) the latency of the R most-recentlycompleted I/Os, where we set R as 4, and (c) the number ofpending I/Os at the time when each of the R completed I/Osarrived. We now reason about these necessary inputs.
